============================

So, you want to write program analysis - you've come to the right place. Welcome to ``r2c``! ``r2c``
is a command line tool for writing and running program analysis components to run at massive
scale. With just a few minutes of setup you can start analyzing hundreds of thousands of projects,
hundreds of millions of commits, and billions of lines of code - getting results at scale on the
``r2c`` platform in under an hour. This is the documentation for the beta release (version
