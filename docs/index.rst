Program analysis, leveled up
============================

So, you want to write program analysis - you've come to the right place. Welcome to ``r2c``! ``r2c``
is a command line tool for writing and running program analysis components to run at massive
scale. With just a few minutes of setup you can start analyzing hundreds of thousands of projects,
hundreds of millions of commits, and billions of lines of code - getting results at scale on the ``r2c`` platform in just a
few hours. This is the documentation for the beta release (version |release|) of the ``r2c`` tool. If you're new here,
we recommend starting with :doc:`intro/index`.
